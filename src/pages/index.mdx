# Introduction

WebLN is a library and set of specifications for lightning apps and client providers to facilitate communication between apps and users' lightning nodes in a secure way. It provides a programmatic, permissioned interface for letting applications ask users to send payments, generate invoices to receive payments, and much more. This documentation covers both how to use WebLN in your Lightning-driven applications, but also how to implement a provider.

You may be interested in using WebLN if you...

- Have an application that accepts or makes Lightning payments to users
- Want to have decentralized identity and authentication in your application
- Are working on a Lightning node wallet, and want to make it easier for your users to interact with Lightning web apps

#### A Quick Note About TypeScript

Code samples in this documentation will be in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
a statically-typed variant of JavaScript. WebLN is fully typed, and it's
highly recommended you use TypeScript when using it for the best developer
experience. Likewise, it's also recommended if you're implementing a provider,
to make certain that you're compliant to the spec.
